#+TITLE: Gödel

A completely experimental, totally undecidable, annotation-free typechecker for
*idiomatic* Clojure

* Goals

- Type-check clojure code as it exists in the wild, with no changes or
  alterations
- Provide live, quick feedback during development and refactoring, over
  providing extensive safety in CI
- Embrace existing clojure idioms for safety (~spec~, ~assert~, ~prepost-map~,
  maybe even tests?) as means of getting additional typing information
- Provide best-in-class error messages that tell you exactly what's wrong, why
  we think it's wrong, and how to fix it.

* Non-goals

- Total correctness (undecidable for idiomatic code without requiring extensive
  annotations, which would make the code un-idiomatic)
- Replacing tests (idiomatic Clojure uses tests for *safety*, whereas Gödel is
  intended to speed up development)
- Good enough to run in CI (this may happen eventually, but being good enough to
  be used as a Flycheck / Syntastic checker during takes strong precedence)
